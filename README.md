# 📱 MediNote Recorder

A Flutter-based audio recording app with background recording, chunked uploads, and cloud storage support.

---

##  Medical Transcription App

Build a Flutter app that doctors can trust with their patient consultations.

The app records audio during medical visits and streams it to a backend for AI transcription.

Sounds simple? Here's the catch—it must work flawlessly when:

- Doctors get phone calls mid-recording  
- They switch to other apps to check drug databases  
- The hospital WiFi drops out  
- Their phone dies at 60% battery (happens more than you'd think)

## Core Requirements

### 1. Real-Time Audio Streaming

- Stream audio chunks to backend during recording (not after)  
- Continue recording with phone locked or app minimized  
- Handle chunk ordering, retries, and network failures  
- Must demonstrate native microphone access with proper gain control  

---

### 2. Bulletproof Interruption Handling

Must survive without losing data:

- Phone calls (auto pause/resume)  
- App switching (EMR, calculator, camera)  
- Network outages (queue locally, retry when back)  
- Phone restarts (recover unsent chunks)  
- Memory pressure (when system kills other apps)  

---

### 3. Theme & Language (State Management Test)

Must survive with no restart required:

- Manual + system dark/light mode (persisted)  
- English/Hindi full UI language switching (persisted, no restart required)  

---

## Technical Stack

- Flutter (no Expo/React Native - we need native performance)  
- Platform channels for native features when needed  
- Android foreground service + iOS background audio
